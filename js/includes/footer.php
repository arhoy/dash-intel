            <p> <strong>Dash-Intel</strong> is my personal Power BI, Tableau and Javascript blogging site.
             It started out as a side project several years to learn web development and review Power BI concepts for myself. 
             During this time I was an analyst at a small marketing company, learning Power BI to build business dashboards for reporting and analysis.
             Over the years I have transitioned from analyst to developer and this site now serves as a holding site for some of my other projects and my web portfolio.
             I still try to keep this site updated regulary. For some of my newer projects please see the links above.
