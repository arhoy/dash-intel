                      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The average is also known as the mean in statistics. This is the sum of values divided by the number of observations.</p>
                      <p>The formula for the mean or average is:</p>
                      <div class="key_equation">
                 
                        <equation>$$\frac{\mbox{ sum of values}}{\mbox{ number of observations}}$$</equation><br>

                     <p><strong>Tip: Averages are</strong> very commonly used to summarize large amounts of data, but often they don't give you an accurate or whole data story. For instance, averages are influenced by <em>outliers</em> (large or small data points relative to your data). In these cases, the <em>median</em> may be a better statistic as this indicates the middle data point.
