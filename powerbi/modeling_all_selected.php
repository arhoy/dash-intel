                <h5>ALLSELECTED</h5>
                  <p>
                      The <em>ALLSELECTED</em> function returns all filters that have been applied using a slicer. It could be useful when you want to compare the ratio between one business type to all that you have selected. 
                 </p>
                 <p>For example in POWER BI we write:</p>
                 
        <pre class="brush:dax; title: ; notranslate" title="">
                Revenue For Selected Business Types = 
                    CALCULATE(SUM(TransactionData[Revenue]),
	                ALLSELECTED(TransactionData[Business Type]))
	                
        </pre>
                 <p>In the table below we have selected the first three business types. The above query is used to return the middle revenue column in the table below:</p>
        </div>
        
           
        <div class="smokebox">
            <h5>ALL</h5>
                 <p>
                  The <em>ALL</em> function acts to remove or overwrite all filters that have been applied using a slicer.
                 </p>

                 
                 <p>
                      The above query is used to return the revenue for all business types regardless of which business type has been selected.
                 </p>
                 
        <pre class="brush:dax; title: ; notranslate" title="">
                    Revenue for ALL_Business_Types = 
                        CALCULATE(SUM(TransactionData[Revenue]),
                        ALL(TransactionData[Business Type]))
                        
        </pre>     

             <img class = "BI_formula" src="images\all_selected.png" alt="" style = "width:100%; height:auto;"><br><br>
        <p>
            If you apply another slicer, for instance on product type, then the filter will be applied and if will become revenue for all business types for the selected products in the filter.
