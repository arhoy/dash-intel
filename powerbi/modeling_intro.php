                   Modeling in Power BI is easy. There is really only three main things you need to know to get started :
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li><a href="modeling_joining_tables.php">Creating Relationships Between Tables</a></li>
                   <li><a href="modeling_measure+calculated+columns.php">Creating Calculated Columns</a></li>
                   <li><a href="modeling_measure+calculated+columns.php">Creating Measures</a></li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                   There is also plenty more you can do with modeling. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a high level language similar to excel where users can enter in specific calculations to a formula bar. With DAX there are many <em>date</em> and <em>time intelligence functions</em> that can be used to help create powerful and automated reports.
